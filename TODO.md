* abstract into trait
* numeric support (int, bigint, float?)
* canBuildFrom support
* subtractable
* abstract aggregation (a trait higher than multiset)
* a discrete multiset extends Iterable, since it is countable
* if a method yields a new collection, push it into a MultisetLike[Repr] trait
